# hello-world

Just-started-so-bare-with-me! New to programming, trying to get my feet wet to start a new lifestyle. 
  Hopefully I can get some advice. Nothing too interesting about me. Just trying to learn and expand some horizons 
   thats all. Even trying to make a couple new freinds along the way. Very intersted in the Cyber Security realm of IT. 
     Figured this ids a great way to start. Experience... mostly help desk and information security, a little bit of software
    patching. I can make a damn good cup of joe that for sure. Hobbies include reading random articles about anything,
  mentoring others in the little that i know, working hard and staying physically fit. I enjoy shooting anything
especially handguns (Pistols).
